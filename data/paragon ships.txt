	description " Composed of the hulls of many different ships, the Reaver is certainly a sight to behold. The Paragon 13 station is the only producer of this strange design, utilizing Dark Age construction methods coupled with modern ship standards. The design was initially for a colony ship, but the insane AI of the station twisted it into a warship."

	description "By the looks of the modification that have taken place, you suspect that this ship contains no original parts. With extra shield emitters, hull plating, and outfit space, this half-millennium-old design is finding new life with its heavy modification."
